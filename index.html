<h1>Responsible @mentions</h1>
<p>Please use good judgement when @mentioning a person, or using @Everyone in a chat. Direct @mentions imply urgency, importance, or direct asks in order to draw one's attention away from other chats, email, or communications. @Everyone also implies a sense or heightened prioritization or urgency to review. @mentions are devalued when they are over-used or not used with proper prioty in mind. Thank you for being selective in your future use!</p>
